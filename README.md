# CSRF and XSS rogue website

Rogue website to demonstrate CSRF and XSS attacks.

## Playing a good victim...

It is important that you run the unprotected branch of the
[target app](https://github.com/utfpr-cesc/csrf-nosqli-xss-application) on
`http://application.com:3000`, assign `application.com`
to `localhost` on your `/etc/hosts` file, and also make
sure you are logged in the target app in order for the attacks to succeed.
